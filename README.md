# DescriptiveStatistics
Stroop Effect
Project Overview
In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, 
then go through the task yourself. we will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task
and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations.
A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions
others have drawn from their investigations.


As part of this project following this are done
a) Identify components of the stroops experiment
b) Use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
c) Setting up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
